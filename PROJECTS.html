        <h2>HOW TO MQTT SERIES</h2>
        <p>MQTT is lightweight and flexible, a key feature being its publish and subscribe model which decouples the publisher and consumer data, making the model asynchronous.</p><br><br>

               MQtt is a messaging standard protocol for IoT which is designed as an extremely light-weight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with unreliable networks, high latency and minimal bandwidth.It is applied in automotive,manufacturing,telecommunication,oil and gas industries.

               <p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>
                <li>To learn how to connect an IoT device (in our case, it’s a NodeMCU module) to an MQTT broker</li><br>

    <h2>SMART FARM</h2>
    <p>Smart farming is an emerging concept that refers to managing farms using Information and Communication Technology to increase quality and quantity of products while optimizing the human labour required and for better utilization of resources throughout the irrigation process.</p>

          <li>Our system aims at regulating the soil moisture levels in farms. We designed a program that will automatically detect a drop or surge in soil moisture level and activate a pump to irrigate the farm otherwise the pump will be turned off respectively.</li><li>This will automate the whole farming system and reduce the time that would take for the farmers to actually do the whole process of manually irrigating the farm even when the moisture content in the soil is the recommended one for the plants as such also conserves water usage. With this type of system, the farmer can water their plants only when needed and avoid over-watering or under-watering.</li>
           <br><br>
           <p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>
            <li>Introduce a reliable and cost effective technology to improve farming.</li><br>
            <li>Empower farmers with advanced connectivity through automated methods of measurement of environmental factors such as soil moisture, humidity and temperature.</li><br>
            <li>Phase out inefficient methods of farming that require a lot of man-power.</li><br>
            <li>Introduce IOT to advance farming skills.</li><br>
            <li>Conservation of water used in farming.</li><br>

        </div>
          <li>An RFID system, for example the RFID based attendance system, has three components- the tag, reader and the antenna. The tag consists of two parts, the antenna that transmits and receives signals, and a chip which stores the tag ID and other relevant information.</li><li>The readers are devices that transmit and receive data so as to communicate with RFID tags. Antennas convert RFID reader’s signal into RF waves that can be picked up by the tags. An active RFID tag has its own power source while a passive one receives power from a reading antenna.</li>

           <p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>

This is done until the flame is brought down to ground level or rather, levels that can be contained before damage is caused.</li><li>In future, we could use a motor with higher torque in order to put out larger accidental fires on time before damage is caused. Also, we could incorporate use of Raspberry Pi or Node MCU  in order to make the system configurable through the internet</li><li>This will introduce the aspect of IoT in our system. As such, to build an Android system and one will be able to control lighting and climate regulation in their house by a simple click of the button from their smartphones.</li>
